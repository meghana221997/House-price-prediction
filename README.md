# House-price-prediction

-	Collaborated in a group project using advanced regression techniques to develop a robust house price prediction model.
-	Utilized libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing and visualization.
-	Implemented regression models including XGBRegressor, Bagging Regressor, and AdaBoost Regressor with decision tree regressors.
-	Employed data preprocessing techniques like outlier removal and feature transformation using MinMaxScaler and evaluated model performance using RMSE and compared the results.
